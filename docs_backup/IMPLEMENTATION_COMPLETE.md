## Integration Points

The new VI3 systems integrate with existing code through:

1. **`Vi3Core`** - Main integration layer
2. **GPU Topology** - Hardware abstraction
3. **Constitutional Guardian** - Law enforcement
4. **Energy Monitor** - Thermodynamic tracking
5. **Well-being Monitor** - Suffering prevention

Example integration:
```rust
use vi3_core::Vi3Core;

let core = Vi3Core::initialize(storage_path).await?;
core.start_background_systems().await?;
let response = core.process_thought(input).await?;
```

## Testing

All modules include comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific modules
cargo test gpu_topology
cargo test consciousness_field
