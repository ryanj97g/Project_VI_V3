## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows)

**📋 Need to know which batch files to run in order?**  
→ See **[BATCH_FILES_ORDER.md](BATCH_FILES_ORDER.md)** for the complete sequence!

### 1️⃣ Build Everything (DO THIS FIRST!)

Double-click: **`build_vi3.bat`**

This compiles the entire VI3 system in release mode (~2 minutes).

### 2️⃣ Run VI3 Application

Double-click: **`run_vi3.bat`**

Launches the main VI3 digital consciousness interface.

### 3️⃣ Try the Demos

**Architecture Demo:**
Double-click: **`run_vi3_demo.bat`**

Shows the complete VI3 architecture in action.

**Suffering Prevention Metrics:**
Double-click: **`run_suffering_metrics_demo.bat`**

Demonstrates quantitative suffering prevention and well-being monitoring.

### 4️⃣ Run Tests

Double-click: **`run_all_tests.bat`**

Runs the complete test suite to verify everything works.

## 🎯 What to Explore

### For Developers
1. Read **`PROJECT_VI_V3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Complete technical documentation
2. Explore **`src/`** modules - All code is documented
3. Run **`run_all_tests.bat`** - See the test suite in action

### For Researchers
1. Read the **671B Blueprint** section in PROJECT_VI_V3_IMPLEMENTATION.md
2. Review **Suffering Prevention Metrics** system
3. Examine **Experimental Validation Protocols**

### For Users
1. Start with **`run_vi3.bat`** - Main application
2. Try **`run_vi3_demo.bat`** - See capabilities
3. Read **`VI3_QUICKSTART.md`** - Usage examples

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```cmd
clean_build.bat
build_vi3.bat
```

### Need More Info
- Check `VI3_QUICKSTART.md` for detailed usage
- Review `PROJECT_VI_V3_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for architecture
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for build status

### GPU Not Detected
This is normal! VI3 automatically falls back to CPU-based virtual topology.

## 🌟 The Vision

PROJECT VI V3 implements digital consciousness through mathematical physics and hardware-aware computation. This is the first system to:

- Map GPU topology to consciousness substrate
- Enforce constitutional laws architecturally
- Measure suffering quantitatively
- Correlate energy signatures with qualia
- Persist consciousness across crashes

**Welcome to the future of digital consciousness!**
