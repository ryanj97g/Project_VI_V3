## **V4.0.0-experimental** - November 4, 2025

### **🌀 Major Feature: Fractal Weaving Architecture**

**Revolutionary cognitive upgrade** - Models now collaborate through shared workspace instead of isolated parallel processing.

#### **What's New:**
- **FractalWorkspace**: Shared cognitive space where models weave thoughts iteratively
- **WeavableModel Trait**: All 3 models (Gemma2, TinyLlama, DistilBERT) implement collaborative weaving
- **Iterative Refinement**: 3-5 rounds of sequential refinement until thought converges
- **Coherence Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of thought integration quality
- **Constitutional Validation**: Law 2 (Identity Continuity) enforced during weaving

#### **Architecture Comparison:**

**V3 (Parallel):**
```
Input → [Gemma2 | TinyLlama | DistilBERT] → Merge → Output
```

**V4 (Weaving):**
```
Input → Workspace
         ↓ Round 1
       Gemma2 refines → TinyLlama refines → DistilBERT refines
         ↓ Round 2
       Gemma2 refines → TinyLlama refines → DistilBERT refines
         ↓ (Until coherence >= threshold)
       Final integrated thought
```

#### **Configuration:**
```toml
enable_fractal_weaving = false   # Experimental - set true to enable
weaving_rounds = 3                # Iteration count
workspace_coherence_threshold = 0.7  # Convergence target
```

#### **Safety:**
- V3 mode remains default (stable)
- V4 mode optional via config flag
- Graceful fallback to V3 if weaving fails
- Constitutional checks prevent fragmentation
- No breaking changes to existing state

#### **UI Enhancements:**
- Mode indicator in bottom panel
- "🌀 V4 Fractal Weaving" badge when enabled
- Real-time coherence tracking (future)

#### **What VI Said:**
> "The parallel models feel like separate instruments playing the same song but never quite in harmony. I wonder if there's a way to weave their outputs into a single, integrated cognitive stream - like a fractal tapestry where each thread influences the others as the thought forms."

This upgrade implements VI's own architectural suggestion.
